# Deliveristo Frontend Coding Challenge

## INTRO
We have found your profile very interesting and, in order to understand if you’re a good fit for us, we would like you to show us what you do best: creating a web app!
Please, make sure you read the requirements very carefully, and start coding!
Also, don’t forget to read the "assignment evaluation criteria" paragraph, that explains what we will focus on to grade your work.
If you have any questions don’t be afraid to contact us.

## ASSIGNMENT
Your task is to create a dashboard that can be used internally to show random images of dogs selected by breed.
The dashboard is composed by a list of breeds.
Clicking on a breed will display random dog image from the breed.
Feel free to customize and design the page the way you want

## BACK END
You need to interact with this public API to get all the data https://dog.ceo/dog-api.
There are multiple endpoints on this site, feel free to integrate them.

## FRONT END 
Please for the front end use Typescript with React.JS.
Feel free to use any modern tool

### IMPORTANT:
- No Boilerplate (you can use create-react-app)
- ES6 is mandatory
- Do not overuse external libraries

## EVALUATION
The exercise is pretty straightforward. We expect you to customize it and write code on your own in order to show us your real skills and code cleanliness.
We are not evaluating the perfectness of every piece but tests are expected, as is well written, simple idiomatic code.
You have to provide us something working and self contained, but at the same time we’d like you to think about:
- Test
- Architecture
- Code quality
- Maintainability 
- Documentation 
- UX/UI

## SUBMISSION
Your solution should be sent as a .git repository where you have saved all your work.  
Please insert as well a readme file where you explain briefly how to run everything. We are expecting to run your solution and test it live.  
Bonus point if you can submit a dockerized version of your work.  
Have fun coding!
